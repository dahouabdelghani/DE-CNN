# DE-CNN
Arabic Sentiment Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network and Differential Evolution Algorithm

In this paper, we address this problem by combining differential evolution (DE) algorithm and CNN, where DE algorithm is used to automatically search the optimal configuration including CNN architecture and network parameters. In order to achieve the goal, five CNN parameters are searched by the DE algorithm which include convolution filter sizes that control the CNN architecture, number of filters per convolution filter size (NFCS), number of neurons in fully connected (FC) layer, initialization
mode, and dropout rate.


The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. Modeling the problem of evolving CNNs as a meta-heuristic optimization task to build an Arabic sentiment classification system.
2. Using two different fitness evaluation techniques to assess the generalization of the CNN.
3. Integrating two different mutation strategies to improve the exploration and exploitation ability of DE algorithm.
4. Building and training different CNN architectures with variable number of parallel convolution layers.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
